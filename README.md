This is the main repository for the [Info-Droplets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022EPSC...16..900B/abstract) project.\
In the SOPROBOTICS club, we are developing a custom artificial GPS tracker system, that supports the research of the hungarian DAMBALL meteorogical balloon team regarding meteoroid dark-flight research.
